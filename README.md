# CS251-Project-1-Ciphers
**Author**: Joe Wu <br>
**Goal**: Ciphers is a C++ program written in VScode that encrypts or decrypts Caesar and Substitution ciphers through functions presented in a menu to the user<br><br>

##### Implementation Instructions 
For descriptions of what the functions in the code do, in the include folder, there are files associated with decrypting caesar ciphers, encrypting caesar ciphers, decrypting substitution ciphers, and encrypting substitution ciphers respectively, that explain the functions used in each action.<br><br>

#### How To Use<br>
The code contains a MAKEFILE to run the program and its test cases easily<br><br>
To run the program type "make ciphers_main" and "make run_ciphers"<br>
Then, the terminal will print out an introduction and a menu for the user to input what they want to do in the program until the user wants to quit<br><br>

"C - Encrypt with Caesar Cipher"<br>
"D - Decrypt Caesar Cipher"<br>
"E - Compute English-ness Score"<br>
"A - Apply Random Substitution Cipher"<br>
"S - Decrypt Substitution Cipher from Console"<br>
"F - Decrypt Substitution Cipher from File"<br>
"R - Set Random Seed for Testing"<br>
"X - Exit Program"<br>
